我把[原文](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1682029195843739649)贴过来，粗略翻译一下。

几周后我将辞去Meta的工作，对此我感到苦乐参半。在Meta的react.org工作一直是我的荣幸。我很感激以前和现在的同事，感谢他们带领我进来、允许我犯错误、帮助我看到自己的力量，他们很友好，为我花了时间。

> i feel bittersweet sharing i’m leaving my job at meta in a few weeks. working in the react org at meta has been an honor. i am thankful to my past and present colleagues for taking me in, letting me make mistakes, helping me see my strengths, being kind, and sharing their time.

在过去的3年里，我一直说我会在大约一年后离开，但一直没找到对的时机。第一，我想完成新文档，第二，我想看到广泛适用的Suspense数据获取的相关整合上线。在团队里工作了几年以后，二者都在今年春天上线了。

> for the past three years, i kept saying i’d leave “in a year or so” but the moment never felt right. i wanted to (1) finish the new docs and (2) see a broadly usable Suspense data fetching integration shipping. after years of work from the team, both have shipped this spring.

之前我对离职有些犹豫，因为不久之前，离开Meta就意味着离开React团队，这对我来说太令人伤心。但现在情况不一样了，React已经成为一个跨公司的项目，而且团队里还有几个独立的工程师。

> i felt hesitant leaving earlier because not too long ago, leaving meta used to mean leaving the react team. that would feel too sad for me. but it is not true anymore. react has become a multi-company project, and there are several independent engineers on the team too.

我也会作为独立工程师留在React团队，就像sophiebits和sebsilbermann一样。这意味着没有公司持续资助我来全职为React工作了，但我依然会参与团队工作，参加我们的会议。

> i am staying on the react team as an independent engineer, similar to [@sophiebits](https://twitter.com/sophiebits) and [@sebsilbermann](https://twitter.com/sebsilbermann). this means that i will not be actively sponsored to work full-time on react by any company, but i will stay involved in the team’s work and attend our meetings.

我对未来会投入到什么工作还不太明晰。7年前我刚加入React团队的生活，我大多数时候都在写代码。但我的组员经常做的比我更好，随着时间的推移，我发现我被其他事情吸引了。

> the exact nature of my future involvement is not yet clear to me. when i started on the react team seven years ago, i used to mostly write code. however, my teammates often outshine me at that, and i found myself gravitating to doing other things over time.

其中一件吸引我的事情就是讲解。我在http://overreacted.io上练习写作。后来rachelnabors鼓励我去把http://react.dev也写了。我在那个项目里倾注了大量心血，但我也感到力有不逮。

> one of the things i naturally gravitated towards was explaining things. i practiced writing on [http://overreacted.io](https://t.co/Bc6qHYEu5W), and later [@rachelnabors](https://twitter.com/rachelnabors) inspired me to write [http://react.dev](https://t.co/JfirTx36Q8) together. i poured my heart into that project, but i bit off a bit more than i could chew.

情况就是我对于写作的要求高了不少，但我的写作能力没跟上。下笔对我来说很困难，因为我连自己的标准都过不了。可能随着时间推移，这个问题不会是问题，但现在我需要停笔歇会了。

> what happened is that my standard for writing has gone higher but my writing ability did not. i find it difficult to write now because i can’t match the standard in my own head anymore. this will probably go away with time, but i need a little break from writing words.

有时人们以为我为React写了很多代码，但其实我有一阵没写了。除了写新文档以外，过去几年我最主要的贡献是“胶水”工作：也就是充当社区和团队之间的桥梁。

> sometimes people think i write a lot of code for react, but i haven’t been doing that for a while. aside from co-writing the new docs, the rest of my contributions in the past few years have mostly been community glue work: being a bridge between the community and the team.

虽然我很享受这类工作，但对我自己来说，我不可能一直做这样的工作，而且这也影响了我的情绪。在某种程度上说，成为单点故障并不有趣，我已经觉得我既辜负了团队、也辜负了社区。我们需要试着扩大规模了。

> although i enjoy this type of work, it is not sustainable to do on my own, and it has taken a toll emotionally. at some point being a single point of failure stops being fun, and i was feeling that i’m failing both the team and the community. we needed to learn to scale it up.

去年以来，我们已经在React团队中组建了一支新的小队，专注于社区的胶水工作。我相信Eli_White、kmiddleton14、lunaleaps、mattcarrollcode、rickhanlonii会接过火把，持续运作下去。我自己也会持续参与其中。

> over the last year, we’ve been building a new wing of the react team focused on community glue work. i trust [@Eli_White](https://twitter.com/Eli_White) [@kmiddleton14](https://twitter.com/kmiddleton14) [@lunaleaps](https://twitter.com/lunaleaps) [@mattcarrollcode](https://twitter.com/mattcarrollcode) [@rickhanlonii](https://twitter.com/rickhanlonii) to carry this torch in a sustainable way. i will stay very closely involved.

在工程方面，我相信Meta的en_JS的技术领导和Vercel的sebmarkbage的技术领导。目前，只有两家公司提供React的全职工作，但在未来，我们也希望能有来自其他公司的全职贡献者。

> on the engineering side, i fully trust [@en_JS](https://twitter.com/en_JS) technical leadership at Meta and [@sebmarkbage](https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage) technical leadership at Vercel. currently, only two companies are sponsoring employees to work full-time on React, but we’d like to onboard contributors from other companies in the future.

最后是一些个人笔记。这并不是什么宏伟的计划。我从来不定“计划”或者“目标”。我只是有预感既然我在意的一些事情还没尘埃落定，是时候去尝试一些新东西，重新当一个新手了。

> finally, a little personal note. this is not a part of some kind of a grand plan. i don’t do “plans” and “goals”. i just had a hunch that now that the things i care about are not going to fall on the floor, it’s the right moment to try something new and feel like a beginner again

我还不知道接下来要做什么，可能做点Youtube视频，做点咨询工作。我也有点手痒，想用React写点代码，快速迭代，不受大公司的束缚。我可能会把上述这些事情结合在一起做。不过我也有点想什么都不做。我们姑且看看：）

> idk what i’ll do next yet. might do some youtube, some consulting. i do feel a bit itchy to write some product code in react with a fast iteration cycle outside of a large company. maybe i’ll do a combination of all of that. i kinda want to just do nothing too. we’ll see :)

我感觉松了一口气，也有点害怕，但更多的是感激，感谢jingc，提醒了我，感谢tmocchino，信任我，感谢sebmarkbage和sophiebits，教了我所有事情。工作是关于人的，而你们是我能想到的最好的人。我们每周同步见！

> i feel a little relieved, a little scared, but mostly thankful. i’m grateful to [@jingc](https://twitter.com/jingc) for noticing me, [@tomocchino](https://twitter.com/tomocchino) for believing in me, and [@sebmarkbage](https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage) & [@sophiebits](https://twitter.com/sophiebits) for teaching me everything. work is people, and you’re the best i could hope for. see y’all at the weekly syncs!

以上。
